adevore3's dotfiles

##Inspiration

This was inspired by anishathalye's [article][managing_your_dotfiles] on how
to manage your own dotfiles using his [dotfiles template][anishathalye_dotfiles_templates]
and [dotbot][dotbot].

##License

This software is hereby released into the public domain. That means you can do

That being said, I would appreciate it if you could maintain a link back to
Dotbot (or this repository) to help other people discover Dotbot.
